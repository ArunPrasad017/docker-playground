# Docker-playground

# Visits:
    - First project is the visits project which keeps a count of the number of times a webpage is visited. 
    - This application uses a docker-compose file with two services (Redis and NodeJS app) running at the same time in same container. 
    - Redis helps in keeping the state/count of the page refreshes and the nodeJS app is simply to load the webpage
